This version of ODEPACK has been modified as to make it compatible with the single-precision version when both are compiled in a program at the same time.

In all the files, the following subroutines contained in opkda1.f have been renamed:
JGROUP	->	DJGROUP
ADJLR	->	DADJLR
CNTNZU	->	DCNTNZU
MD		->	DMD	
MDI		->	DMDI	
MDM		->	DMDM	
MDP		->	DMDP	
MDU		->	DMDU	

In all the files, the following subroutines contained in opkda2.f have been renamed:
XSETF	->	DXSETF
XSETUN	->	DXSETUN
IXSAV	->	DIXSAV
IUMACH	->	DIUMACH

In the subroutines SLSODAR, SSTODA and SPRJA the argument 'F' has been declared
as a pointer. --> REVERTED TO ORIGINAL on 5.5.2016.
In the subroutines SLSODAR and SRCHEK the argument 'G' has been declared as a
pointer. --> REVERTED TO ORIGINAL on 5.5.2016
The "pointerized" versions now have the "_pointers" suffix in their filename.
